# Database Management System

- It is a software system that allows users to store, organize, and manage data in a database. 
- A database is a collection of data that is organized in a specific way, usually into tables that are related to one another.

# SQL
- SQL stands for Structured Query Language, and it is a programming language used to manage and manipulate relational databases.
- SQL allows users to create, modify, and retrieve data from databases, as well as to perform various operations such as sorting, filtering, and aggregating data.
- SQL is a declarative language, meaning that users specify what they want the database to do rather than how to do it. 

# NoSQL
- NoSQL stands for "Not only SQL," and it refers to a category of databases that do not use the traditional SQL (Structured Query Language) for storing and retrieving data. 
- NoSQL databases use different data models and query languages to manage and access data.
- designed to handle large-scale, unstructured, and semi-structured data.

# Types of Databases

| SQL                                              | NoSQL  | 
| :------------:                                   |:---------------:| 
| RELATIONAL DATABASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM (RDBMS)    | Non-relational or distributed database system. | 
| fixed or static or predefined schema             | They have dynamic schema        |  
| not suited for hierarchical data storage         | best suited for hierarchical data storage        | 
| best suited for complex queries                  | not so good for complex queries |
| Vertically Scalable                              | Horizontally scalable|
| Follows ACID property                            | Follows CAP(consistency, availability, partition tolerance)

# Types of NoSQL databases
**1. Document-oriented databases:** These databases store data in the form of documents, which can be nested and hierarchical. Examples include MongoDB and Couchbase.

**2. Key-value stores:** These databases store data as key-value pairs, making them useful for caching and high-speed data retrieval. Examples include Redis and Riak.

**3. Column-family stores:** These databases store data in column families, which contain columns of related data. Examples include Apache Cassandra and HBase.

**4. Graph databases:** These databases store data in a graph format, which is useful for modeling relationships between data points. Examples include Neo4j and OrientDB.

**5. Object-oriented databases:** These databases store data in the form of objects, which can be used to represent complex data structures. Examples include db4o and Versant.
