# Database Management System

- It is a software system that allows users to store, organize, and manage data in a database. 
- A database is a collection of data that is organized in a specific way, usually into tables that are related to one another.

# SQL
- SQL stands for Structured Query Language, and it is a programming language used to manage and manipulate relational databases.
